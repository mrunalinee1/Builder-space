**BuilderSpace: Property Management System**(IN progress)

BuilderSpace is a comprehensive Property Management System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It is designed to help builders efficiently manage their properties, from listing and showcasing properties to handling inquiries and managing sales.

### Features:
- **Property Listings:** Easily list and manage properties with detailed information such as location, size, amenities, price, etc.
- **Image Gallery:** Showcase property images to attract potential buyers or renters.
- **Inquiry Management:** Manage inquiries from interested buyers or renters, track communication, and follow up effectively.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication system to manage access and permissions.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Intuitive dashboard for builders to monitor property listings, inquiries, and other key metrics.
- **Customizable:** Highly customizable to suit specific business requirements and branding needs.

### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend:** React.js, React Router, Axios, Bootstrap (or Material-UI for UI components)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (Mongoose for database interaction)
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication


### Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (database connection string, JWT secret, etc.).
4. Run the development server:
   - Backend: `npm start` or `node server.js`
   - Frontend: `npm start`
5. Access the application in your browser: `http://localhost:3000`
